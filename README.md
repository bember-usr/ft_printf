# `🗣️ About`
> *This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.*

For detailed information, refer to the subject of this project.

`🚀 TLDR`: ****this project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
information below) of the printf function.****
